mikromedia HMI is a product line of 18 smart displays intended to be used as OEM parts. It's a spinoff from the original mikromedia, the feature-rich multimedia development board. Because a subset of our customers started integrating ordinary mikromedia boards into serial products, we created mikromedia HMI, a version optimized for scale â€“ removing all excessive circuitry from the original mikromedia to lower the cost, keeping only the essential components that simplify its integration into a final product.

All mikromedia HMI boards are powered by FT900Q, FTDI Chip's 32-bit MCU with their proprietary RISC architecture, with FT812 or FT813 graphic controllers driving the Riverdi brand displays. The boards are available in four screen sizes: 3.5", 4.3", 5", 7", with different touchscreen options (capacitive, resistive, or without). For integrating into larger systems, they either have mounting frames or glass bezels.

The hardware is fully compatible with mikroC, mikroBasic and mikroPascal for FT90x, as well as Visual TFT, the GUI design software.
